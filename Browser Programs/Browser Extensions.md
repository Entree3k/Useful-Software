# Browser Extensions

Enhance your browsing experience with these useful extensions:

### [ClearUrls](https://gitlab.com/KevinRoebert/ClearUrls/-/blob/master/README.md): Removes tracking from URLs automatically in the background. Lightweight and useful.

### SponsorBlock(https://sponsor.ajay.app/): A crowdsourced extension: Users submit when a sponsor happens from the extension, and the extension automatically skips sponsors it knows about. Almost 9M skip segments in the crowdsourced database.
